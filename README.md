# Line Segment Detection and Description Evaluation

**X. Lin, Y. Zhou, Y. Liu and C. Zhu, "A Comprehensive Review of Image Line Segment Detection and Description: Taxonomies, Comparisons, and Challenges," in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (T-PAMI), 2024.**

## Getting Started

To run the example, follow these steps:

1. Install [mexopencv](https://kyamagu.github.io/mexopencv/) to obtain the "DescriptorMatcher" and "RotatedRect" function.  
2. Run the "eva_detection_w_demo.m" script to evaluate line segment detection algorithms with ground truth line segments.  
3. Run the "eva_detection_wo_demo.m" script to evaluate line segment detection algorithms without ground truth line segments.  
4. Run the "eva_description_demo.m" script to evaluate line segment description algorithms.
